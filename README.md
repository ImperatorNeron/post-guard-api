# PostGuardAPI - Task from Starnavi

## Overview

PostGuardAPI is a RESTful API designed for managing user-generated content, including posts and comments. It incorporates artificial intelligence for automatic comment blocking and intelligent auto-replies to user inquiries. The API also provides analytical insights into comments, including metrics on created and blocked comments, authentication by jwt etc.

## Requirements

2. Install all required packages in **Requirements** section.
3. Set up environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory and specify the required configurations. You can use .env.template.
4. reate a directory named certificates within the app folder, and generate the private.pem and public.pem files for JWT token generation. You can do this using the following commands: 
```bash
# Generate an RSA private key, of size 2048
openssl genrsa -out jwt-private.pem 2048
# Extract the public key from the key pair, which can be used in a certificate
openssl rsa -in jwt-private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out jwt-public.pem
```
